If a face-up \"Fossil\" Fusion Monster(s) you control is destroyed by card effect, you can place 1 Dig Counter on this Skill (max. 1). Once per turn, during your Main Phase, you can remove 1 Dig Counter from this Skill to Fusion Summon 1 \"Fossil\" Fusion Monster from your Extra Deck, by banishing materials mentioned on it from any GYs (except for materials with a specific GY requirement listed.)
