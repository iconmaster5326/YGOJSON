      "effect": "While \"Dark Necrofear\" is face-up on your field, \"Destiny Board\" and \"Spirit Message\" cards you control are unaffected by your opponent's card effects. If a \"Spirit Message\" card would be placed on your field with \"Destiny Board\", you can Special Summon it as a Normal Monster (Fiend/DARK/Level 1/ATK 0/DEF 0) instead. It cannot be targeted for attacks, but does not prevent your opponent from attacking you directly. Once per turn, you can reveal 1 \"Spirit Message\" card in your hand and place it on the bottom of the Deck, then draw 1 card."
